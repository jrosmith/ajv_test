# To run:  
* Clone repo
* ```cd path/to/project/```
* ```npm install```
* ```node call_test.js```

*Note:*

Schema adminCommand1 considers the objToValidate to be *valid.*
Schema adminCommand2 considers the objToValidate to be *invalid.*

objToValidate is indeed initialized to be *invalid.*

This is broken off from a large project so I apologize for the file structure.

* ```adminUserSchema``` and ```userSchema``` live under schemas/subschemas
